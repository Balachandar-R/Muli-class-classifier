I feel that changing the settings in the system so that the system never asks for automatic updates looks like a solution..PLEASE HELP

I am working at client site and I would like to connect to the SSLVPN so that I can access the servers deployed in UST network. These servers are owned by the account and maintained as per the contract with the client. I have approval from the client to connect to SSLVPN using their laptop and I was doing that for quite some time. However recently the client updates the laptops with Windows 10 Enterprise OS. After that update, I am not able to connect to SSLVPN to use Remote Desktop. In fact the UAG client components are not getting prompted to install on first access of the UAG portal.

Here is my config:
OS: Windows 10 Enterprise
Browser: IE11, 32bit
Antivirus: Symantc End Point Protection
Domain: STARBUCKS

Is there any way I can make SSLVPN available on Win 10 Enterprise?

Thank you

Hi, To whom ever it may concern,

i'm facing a lot of issues with my laptop from long time...mostly performance issues

please note my below findings
- my system is running with Win 10 OS, it is taking too much time to load when compared to a normal system, one of your L1 engineer told me that it is a problem with Win 10 OS (i'm not sure its OS issue)
- problem while connecting to office Wi-Fi, i'm not sure why it wont connect properly when i start my system, every time i have spend atleast 10-15 min to connect Wi-Fi itself still it wont help me(already contacted L1 team, suggested me to forget the wi-fi network and reconnect again).
- problem with system performance, as per my work i suppose to use multiple applications simultaneously but this system is not letting me to do so, it will take time to switch between applications.
- clearpass will be showing quarantine and it wont allow me to connect wi-fi but if i connect to office LAN it is working fine (Clearly not sure why ?)
- problem with my Cisco Anyconnect application, i don't know when it will work properly, while connecting VPN if i enable proxy(ust.pac) it will not connect, if i disable it gives error ' connection attempt timedout' so how could i possibly connect to VPN and work.
- of-course this system has battery issues, it won't last for more than an hour (already raised a concern about this but they have replaced only charger not battery)


i have a desktop computer but i never faced any issue with that, this laptop is for me to support in emergency cases for immediate support and client meetings, till now i managed it somehow but not anymore.

the reason for raising a concern now is next week i'm going to client location and i'm surely cannot able to work with all of this issues over there, it will effect my productivity so resolve this issues ASAP or help me replacing with another with better performance at the earliest.",Asset,3 - Moderate,Closed,UST - Deskside,Haris Abbas,4/7/2017 11:51,U53105

Issues are:
1.	System is very slow.
2.	Too much time (>15 minutes) is taking for loading the profile after rebooting.
3.	Citrix receiver is not installed properly so that I'm not able to access Insure portal for access the jump off server. L1 team tried multiple workaround but failed. 
	Final workaround they suggested:- Install Citrix receiver again after the format.
4.	Visual studio asp.net core update is failed due to the unavailability of space in the drive ""C:\""

1. Can the direct deposit be uploaded systematically or needs to be sent to HR only ?

2. Which of the below option should be selected if new account has to be added and partial salary has to be deposited to newly added second account ?

 a. Account Information change OR

 b.  Add New account

3. Direct deposit form provides option to mention the whole dollar amount per pay period or net amount. How would this work when salary is revised ?

4. Lastly, if sent the updated details, would this be effective from next pay period ?

I have open a case last month for the salary miss for one week. The case number is HR Case - HRC0041142. Unfortunately this month also the money was not processed. I got only 24 days salary in the month of February 2017 out of 28 days. It seems last 1 week salary was not processed in the month of February 2017. I was checked the time sheet entry and found that one week time was not routed for manager approval. I had routed it and my manager approved the same. I was in an impression that it would process along with current month salary, but that did not happened. Could you please help me to sort this out at earliest convenience.
